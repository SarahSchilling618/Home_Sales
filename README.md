# Home_Sales
Module 22 Challenge

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that imports a csv file of house sales, and by creating temporary views we can use sql language to answer specific questions about the average prices of a house given some key variables. We then cache a temporary table, and by partitioning the same data set are able to get a clearer view of the dataset that presents the information we are looking for in a clear and concise manor. I used information that I learned while in class, as well as the XPert Learning Assistant provided on Bootcamp Spot to help complete this assignment.
